# ðŸŒˆ DropMilk Vision

DropMilk is a music visualizer built on the soul of MilkDrop â€” but reborn with modern tools, performance, and community love.

We aim to:
- Make creating presets accessible via GUI
- Preserve the math-art spontaneity of classic MilkDrop
- Run smoothly at 4K/120fps on modern systems
- Be modular and extendable (desktop first, maybe browser later)

## Long-Term Dream

We want to create a **live art tool** â€” part VJ software, part meditative space. A visualizer where:
- Flowers bloom to bass drops
- Trails react to vocals
- Users can write, remix, and animate math visually

Welcome to DropMilk. Weâ€™re painting with sound.
