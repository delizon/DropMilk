# 🥛 DropMilk

> *Oops. We spilled the milk. Now it’s art.*

**DropMilk** is a modern, open-source, audio-reactive visualizer inspired by the legendary [MilkDrop](https://github.com/milkdrop2049/milkdrop). It turns music into math-powered, real-time visual poetry.

💡 Whether you're vibing in your room or VJ-ing at a show — DropMilk is your creative playground.

## 🌈 Vision

DropMilk isn't just a tribute to MilkDrop. It's a reinvention:
- 🧠 **Math meets art** – Real-time equations become evolving visual life.
- 🎶 **Sound-reactive visuals** – Driven by bass, rhythm, voice, texture.
- 🎛️ **Visual Studio** – A GUI to tweak presets on the fly, no coding required.
- 🪞 **Modern renderer** – Powered by today’s GPUs, up to 4K+.
- 🧰 **Open-source** – Built by dreamers, tinkerers, and artists.
