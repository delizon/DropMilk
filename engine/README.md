# ðŸ§  Engine

This folder will house the core rendering and visualization engine.

Initial experiments may use:
- WebGL (via Three.js or raw)
- OpenGL via C++ or Rust
- Unity (as rapid prototype)
- Audio analysis with FFT
- Shader language (GLSL or HLSL)

We're still deciding the tech stack â€” contributors welcome!
